# Chirper Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

## Project Setup

* clone the Project - `git@github.com:udacity/reactnd-chirper-app.git`
* install the dependencies - `npm install`
* npm update. stop the server and run following - `npm add react-redux' 'npm update react react-dom`,  `npm add redux`
* run server
* `add redux-thunk`
* If you get the error TypeError: Cannot call a class as a function, check you haven't imported thunk from react-thunk rather than redux-thunk.


## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
